Product description

Are you looking for maximum tactical flexibility with your sling?

Our sling will fit any tactical rifle or shotgun on any sling or swivel mount

Tactical shooters like the 1-point sling configuration to quickly raise the rifle to presentation position and to easily shift from right to left shoulder or quickly drop the rifle to access left or right pistol. 

Shift shoulders to look and shoot around left or right corners.

The one-handed (right or left) easy-release clips allow you to quickly disengage the rifle to switch weapons without removing a helmet, hat, gloves, or other tactical gear.

Easily adjust to the proper size. Very sturdy and lightweight sling, constructed with superior quality Nylon material, durable and comfortable.
