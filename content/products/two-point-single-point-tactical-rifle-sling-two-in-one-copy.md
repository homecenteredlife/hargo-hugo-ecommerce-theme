Product description

Are you looking for maximum tactical flexibility with your sling?

Our sling will fit any tactical rifle or shotgun you own and any sling connections

Competitive shooters like the 2-point configuration to stabilize their aim and help control recoil. Or quickly switch to a 1-point sling configuration to easily shift from right to left shoulder use or quickly drop your rifle to access your left or right pistol.  

The one-handed easy-adjust loop allows you to quickly cinch your rifle secured to your back and free up both hands or loosen the sling for rapid presentation or wrap around your arm to stabilize your aim.
